            <h1 id="welcome">Welcome to City of Crime</h1>
            <p>City of Crime is an online role-playing game and community where the players strive for fame in a
                virtual music industry.</p>
            <p>You start the game as a complete nobody with nothing but your hopes and dreams. You can raid gangs,
                sell a few gigs, and begin to build a mafia. Play your cards right and you'll soon
                be conquering the world, cutting chart-topping records, and leaving a wake of tantalizing scandals
                behind you!</p>
